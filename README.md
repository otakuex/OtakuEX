Otaku Explorer - A guided exploration of the Anime World with your known likes and interests as a compass.

__Thesis of a Cool Angle:__

In the last 15 years or so, anime titles have exploaded in numbers due to advances in technology making the production process [easier/faster/better/cheaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDpmVUEjagg&t=1m53s). This is a double-edged sword. While there's more to choose from, there's also more titles that you subjectively don't care for and more objectively bad titles that should've never been made in the first place. Wading through these can be tiring for the most enthusiastic anime fan. That's where we come in - start with the page for any title you like and explore out from there. Maybe you only care about the visuals of a show, or only want certain story types or themes. No problem! Our similarities rating system will help you find your personal diamonds in the rough.

__Purpose of this project:__
- Scrape information about anime series/movies from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anime_companies/), [AniDB.net](http://anidb.net/) (may be a TOS conflict), and other sources to build a DB of all info available and display it in a front end web UI.
- Allow and encourage user ratings on quality and similarity of different titles based on multiple categories (i.e. "this show is like this other in terms of visual style, but more like this other-other one in terms of story and themes").
- Once there is a well developed rating of similarities, users can see titles of interest from other users of similar likes or demographic profiles.

__Additional goals that may be outside this project:__
- Front page news feed with topics relavent to the Anime Community, like [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com), but smarter with custom feed categories targeting individual user interests, like [Google News](https://news.google.com/).
- Community forums with auto-promotion of users to mods and admins. Once certain levels are reached, users can elect to complete a site standards and practices course to be allowed to post articles to the front page news stream with content and tone appropriate to the site. These posts will be subject to peer review before going public.
- Other unidentified benefits to the community (e.g. Gaming voice chat service, list of trusted retailers by region, cosplay general tutorials and discussion like [The PropTarts of Punished Props](https://www.facebook.com/groups/theproptarts/), cosplay photo galleries separated by media type like anime/manga, video game, comic book, etc.).
